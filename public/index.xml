      <description>In the previous article we unpacked the sample using various methods. In this post we will do static and dynamic analysis on the given sample.
‍
Static analysis
The sample communicates over the internet, possibly to a C2 server, using DNS resolution, HTTP GET/POST, and low-level sockets. It builds and sends HTTP requests, reads headers, and handles responses.
‍
The malware uses encryption to protect its data or payload, likely for obfuscation or C2 encryption.</description>

      <description>What is a Malware
Malware (short for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to computers, servers, networks, or data. It is used by cybercriminals to steal, encrypt, or delete data, hijack systems, spy on user activity, or disrupt operations.
‍
why malware analysis is Important
Malware analysis is important because it helps us understand how harmful software works, what it targets, and how it spreads. This knowledge allows security tools to detect and block threats more effectively.</description>
